	<p id="Desc">
		<b>In the world of Database Management System SQL plays a vital role in the retrieval and management of data. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. As clear from the above-extended form SQL this language helps in database management through user input queries. This tutorial is basically to make the viewers understand and get accustomed to SQL. So lets get started.</b>

<p id="para">
<b>SQL is very proficient in the field of Relational Database Management System like Oracle, MS SQL, MS Access, SQL Servers, etc.  Uses SQL as their query language. The applications of SQL are vast. Some of them include:-</b></p><b>
<ul id="important">
	<li id="sub1">Allows user to retrieve the data.</li>
	<li id="sub2">Allows user to manipulate the data.</li>
	<li id="sub3">Allows user to connect with the database. </li>
	<li id="sub4">Allows the user to delete or drop databases.</li>
</ul>
</b>


<h1 id="uses">INITIAL STEPS TO START WORKING WITH SQL </h1>
<p>
<b>First and foremost step is creation of database.The steps for creating database is shown below:</b></p>
<b>
<ul id="important"> 
	<li id="sub1">CREATE DATABASE DATABASE_NAME;</li>
	<li id="sub2">After creation we need to enter into it.</li>
	<li id="sub3">USE DATABASE_NAME; </li>
	<li id="sub4">This will help us to create a database and then use it.We can create a table after entering into the database.</li>
</ul>

	We can interact with the database with the help of SQL, and SQL does it by implementing some commands. Some SQL commands are as follows:-
	<ul id="important">
	<li id="sub1">CREATE- Creates a new table or other projects in Databases</li>
	<li id="sub2">SELECT- Selects certain records from one or more tables.</li>
	<li id="sub3">INSERT- Creates a record. </li>
	<li id="sub4">UPDATE- It modifies a record</li>
	<li id="sub4">DELETE- Deletes record.</li>
	<li id="sub4">DROP- Deletes the entire table or a view of a table.</li>
</ul>

<p>So these were some of the basic commands of SQL needed while manipulating with the database.</p>

<b>
Let us now talk about RDBMS. RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS acts as the base for SQL (not only SQL but also other database systems). Now let us discuss some of the terms in the fields of RDBMS. 
</b> </p>
<P>
	<b>
		TABLES<br>
The data in a database is stored in a region called TABLES. The table is a collection of similar databases and data entries and many columns and rows. <br>
<br>
<br>+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
<br>|UID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
<br>+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
<br>|1|Ramesh|32|Ahmedabad|2000.00|
<br>|2|Rajdeep|25|Delhi|1500.00|
<br>|3| Roma |23|Kota|2000.00|
<br>|4|Bipasha|25|Mumbai|6500.00|
<br>|5|Saptarshi|27|Bhopal|8500.00|
<br>|6|Subhrojyoti|22| MP  |4500.00|
<br>|7|Koustav|24|Indore|10000.00|
<br>+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+

	
	<br>
	<BR>
	<BR>
	FIELDS<br>
Each table is broken up into much smaller entity called Fields. In the above table UID, NAME, AGE, ADDRESS, SALARY constitutes a field along with the data within it.
<hr>
<BR>
<BR>
</p>
<p>
ROWS<BR>
<BR>   |2|Rajdeep|25|Delhi|1500.00|
<BR>

<BR> This is known as a Row. A database contains an ample amount of Rows constituting data values in it.
<BR>
<hr>
</p>
<p>
<br>
COLUMNS
<BR>

The vertical entity in a database is called Columns. For example-<br>

<br>|ADDRESS   |
<br>+-----------+
<br>|Ahmedabad|
<br>|Delhi|
<br>|Kota|
<br>|Mumbai|
<br>|Bhopal|
<br>| MP   |
<br>|Indore|
